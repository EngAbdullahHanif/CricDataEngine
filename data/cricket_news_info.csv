Cummins hails Green as 'the complete package',"ShareTweet Australian Test captain Pat Cummins heaped praise on allrounder Cameron Green and Travis Head after his team thrashed England by 146 runs in the fifth Test in Hobart to complete a 4-0 rout in the Ashes. Green turned the game on its head on Day 3 with his fiery six-over spell on either side of the Tea break that triggered a dramatic English collapse of 10 for 56. Set a target of 271, England looked well on their way courtesy openers Rory Burns and Zak Crawley's 68-run stand but Green broke the partnership at the stroke of Tea by dismissing the former. He returned soon after the break and sent Dawid Malan and Crawley packing in his succeeding overs to induce a free fall. That after already having chipped in a vital first innings 74 in a 121-run partnership with Travis Head, who notched up two centuries in four games. Cummins was effusive in his praise of the duo. ""Last summer I thought he showed signs of his potential and this summer he was really confident. I think he grew as a batter and bowler throughout it. And he's just as good as any all-rounder in the world at the moment,"" Cummins said of Green. ""For someone so young, as a captain, I feel really lucky, not only to draw on him as a bowler but when he's next in to bat I just feel so calm. ""As a bowler, he's a genuine fourth quick. I feel like I turn to him sometimes before I turn to myself or someone else. he's just got that bounce, he's got the control, incredible skills. And he's been bowling so well, we've only had to bowl him 10 or 15 overs a day or an innings. Again, you forget how young he is, seeing the guy as well he's absolutely the complete package. He's young so we have to keep looking after him but a bright future ahead."" On a comeback trail, Head finished the Ashes as the leading run-getter on either side with two centuries in four games and 357 runs overall at an average of 59.5 to bag the Player of the Series award. ""Someone like Trav Head he's still seen as one of one the younger payers but he's got hell of lot of experience in domestic cricket. He's played a lot. And he goes about it a little bit differently to most other batters which is his biggest strength. As a captain, I don't care if he gets out in non traditional ways. I just want him to go out, be free and play his game. I think being dropped last year and coming in this year he came with a real calmness about him, real confidence and you saw that straight away at the Gabba, he just played his game and he's just really grown,"" Cummins said of the centurion. The Australian captain himself had a dream run in his very first, high-profile assignment in-charge of the Test side. Despite missing a game after being deemed a close contact of a COVID-positive case, Cummins finished as the leading wicket-taker of the series with 21 scalps at an average a shade over 18, a fifer on captaincy debut and a seven-wicket match haul to seal it in Hobart - quashing all doubts about how the additional responsibility will affect his bowling. ""That was probably my biggest worry in accepting the role as captain,"" Cummins said. ""I'm in the team as a bowler, I want to make sure that's protected and I'm able to perform as well as I like. I think with each game I felt better with managing that, I could really switch off, take off the captain's hat for my overs. ""Even the little things with bowling changes, I feel like I got better at managing that. It might be difficult in the heat or longer innings but I feel like it's something I'll only get better at."" Cummins however noted that his next challenge as a captain is to ensure Australia replicate the same success overseas. ""To be the best side in the world you have to win at home but almost and more importantly you need to be successful overseas,"" the 28-year-old said when asked where he wants to take this side. ""We haven't played a whole lot overseas in the last couple of years. Pakistan, Sri Lanka, India next year, England, it's all really foreign conditions to Australia. That will be our challenge. I feel we are really well suited with a squad of 15 plus extras who aren't here who can offer a lot in those conditions. This is hopefully the beginning. I feel we're all in a really good place. There are no imminent retirees, so hopefully, we're building something big the next few years. ""I thought the way we played on day one, we were 3-12. These are quite foreign conditions to what we normally expect in Australia - green seaming wicket. I thought the way Marnus, Trav Head, CG took on the game was a really good template for any conditions that are really foreign that we might expect. ""We can be the type of team that are brave enough to take that positivity overseas if we need to. I think that puts us in a great place. Again, we had a squad of 15 players used through this series. Everyone brings slightly different skills and goes about it slightly differently. I'm really excited about the upcoming Pakistan tour. We have played really well here in Australia now it's up to us to take that overseas,"" he said. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,16/01/2022

Williams ton powers Zimbabwe to 296,"ShareTweet Sean Williams' 87-ball 100 and Regis Chakabva's 72 of 81 helped Zimbabwe set a challenging target for Sri Lanka in the first ODI in Pallekele on Sunday (January 16). Opting to bat against a Sri Lankan side that made five changes from their last ODI, Zimbabwe finished with 296 for 9. Chakabva, who was put down by Charith Asalanka at first slip off Nuwan Pradeep when he had scored only 2, made Sri Lanka pay for the miss as he put on an 80-run opening stand with Takudzwanashe Kaitano. Playing his first ODI, the 28-year-old Kaitano was the aggressor in the partnership as he struck regular boundaries. Kaitano was quick to put away anything that was short while there were also a couple of edges that resulted in fours. Chakabva, who had scored only 14 off 27 in the first 10 overs, bettered his strike rate with a few boundaries. The partnership, however, came to an end in the 15th over. Kaitano was put down by Nissanka at cover but could not capitalise on the reprieve as he failed a read a googly from Jeffrey Vandersay and was trapped in front. Chakabva, meanwhile, got to his fourth ODI fifty in the 19th over with a single, getting there off 49 balls, having struck a six and a four earlier in the over. Kamindu Mendis ended Craig Ervine's stay by as the Zimbabwe captain got an inside edge on to the stumps. But the visitors made steady progress as Chakabva and Sean Williams put on a half-century stand. Williams scored at a strike rate of over 100 in the third wicket association while Chakabva was brisk as well, as the pair rotated the strike well along with timely boundaries. Chakabva's innings came to an end when Vandersay struck in the 30th over to bag his second wicket. The 34-year-old opening batsman tried to fetch a sweep from outside off but ended up gloving the ball to the 'keeper, with Sri Lanka having to take the DRS route for the decision to go in their favour. Williams did not allow Sri Lanka to gain momentum with the wicket as he received support from Sikandar Raza in a 46-run partnership to power Zimbabwe forward. A double-wicket over from Nuwan Pradeep and Wellington Masakadza's run out left Williams to do most of the work in the death overs, and the experienced left-hander was up to the task as he targetted Chamika Karunaratne who ended up conceding 16 in the 48th over. The 49th over, which was bowled by Pradeep, yielded only four runs as Williams brought up his fifth ODI ton. But he was bowled on the final over by Karunaratne, who also picked up the wicket of Blessing Muzarabani. But Richard Ngarava finished off with a six and a four as Zimbabwe finished close to the 300 mark. Brief scores: Zimbabwe 296/9 in 50 overs (Sean Williams 100, Regis Chakabva 72, Takudzwanashe Kaitano 42; Chamika Karunaratne 3-69, Nuwan Pradeep 2-54, Jeffrey Vandersay 2-44) vs Sri Lanka.

Australia complete 4-0 series win after another England collapse,"ShareTweet Mark Wood may have expected to put his feet up, at least for an evening, after the rigours of the opening session. Yet late on the third evening at Hobart, on a day he'd taken a career-best 6 for 39, he was out facing Pat Cummins. If he was indeed frustrated, it showed. He hit the ball as hard as he could for two boundaries before dragging the third one on to his stumps, walking off to some sympathetic applause among the more delirious one. England have a proclivity for batting collapses but even by their standards, losing all 10 wickets over a 56-run stretch was frightening. Chasing 271, England got their first half-century opening stand of the series. Zak Crawley and Rory Burns put on 68 but two hours after murmurs of a fourth-innings chase began to take shape, they were out shaking hands with the opposition as England folded for 124, conceding the Ashes series 0-4. Three Australian bowlers - Cameron Green, Scott Boland and Cummins - took three wickets apiece but England, though, were their own worst enemy, with several batsmen guilty of not applying themselves. England's hopes were dented at the stroke of Tea when Rory Burns played on to a Green delivery. Until then, he and Crawley had survived the vagaries of the pitch and unfurled pleasing drives either side of the wicket. It was Green who opened the floodgates on the other side of the interval. Dawid Malan wore a bouncer on his head and then chopped a delivery onto his stumps. Crawley, who had moved on to 36 serenely, went searching for a booming drive to a full Green ball that swung away late and nicked off to the keeper. His job done, Green handed over the reins to his more senior bowling partners. Mitchell Starc had Ben Stokes pulling a short ball straight to deep square leg while Joe Root was the victim of a Boland ball that kept low and disturbed his woodwork. Boland added the wickets of Chris Woakes and Sam Billings before the captain returned to claim three of the final four wickets to finish with a series tally of 21. Before all the ignominy, Wood had provided genuine grounds for England optimism when he hurled short balls at rapid speed to knock Australia out for 155 in their second innings. His list of victims in the afternoon included Steve Smith who couldn't control a pull shot and holed out at fine leg. Wood's six-over burst (3 for 12) in the first session had Australia reduced to 63/6 with a sub-200 target on the cards. Alex Carey, though, scored a valuable 49 after being dismissed off a no-ball to push the total to 270. It was a target too far for this England batting line-up, who couldn't cash the cheque that Wood had written. Brief scores: Australia 303 & 155 (Alex Carey 49; Mark Wood 6-37) beat England 188 & 124 (Zak Crawley 36; Scott Boland 3-18, Pat Cummins 3-42, Cameron Green 3-21) by 146 runs.

Wood takes six; England set 271 for victory,"ShareTweet Mark Wood registered career-best figures of 6 for 37 to keep England in the hunt in the Hobart Day-Night Ashes Test. The seamer used his short-ball ploy to great effect as Australia were bowled out for 155 in their second innings before Tea on Day 3. England, riding on the fillip provided by their pace ace, made an encouraging start to a challenging target of 271, with Rory Burns and Zak Crawley putting on 68 - England's highest opening stand of the series - before the former played on off Cameron Green on the stroke of Tea. Wood had completed his third Test match fifer in the first session of the day and came back after the Dinner break to castle Pat Cummins and close out the third innings of this Test. Between that though Australia found 49 useful runs from their keeper-bat Alex Carey, who pushed the lead past 250, a psychological target considered beyond an under-fire England's grasp. Notwithstanding the Carey cameo, Wood was the story of the first two sessions as England fought their way back after conceding a 115-run first-innings lead. As early as the fourth over of the day, he hit the hard length and got a delivery to climb steeply towards Scott Boland's throat, something the nightwatchman could only glove to the 'keeper. Two overs later, he accounted for first-innings centurion Travis Head, who became the latest in a list of batsmen strangled down the legside in this game. The short ball theory, however, got its greatest stamp of approval when Steve Smith was consumed on the pull at fine-leg. Australia at that stage were reduced to 63 for 6 with England entertaining the possibility of chasing a target under or close to 200. Expectedly there was resistance once Wood's impressive spell of 6-0-12-3 came to an end. Alex Carey and Cameron Green got together to add risk-free runs but not without some luck along the way. Carey played on to a Chris Woakes delivery while on 19 only for the third umpires to reveal that the bowler had marginally overstepped. Carey was also adjudged LBW, a decision that he overturned with a review. The 49-run partnership was eventually ended when Broad had Green ruled out LBW with a review. Wood then returned for another spell and used his patented short ball to have Mitchell Starc caught at short leg to complete a well-deserved five-wicket haul. He'd opened the door for England and given his batters a chance to redeem themselves at the end of a bruising series. Brief scores: England 68/1 (Zak Crawley 32*; Cameron Green 1-4) & 188trail Australia303 & 155 (Alex Carey 49; Mark Wood 6-37) by 203 runs. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,16/01/2022
"Zaman, Shadab Khan, Rauf to leave BBL for PSL preparation","ShareTweet Pakistan Cricket Board has asked Fakhar Zaman, Shadab Khan and Haris Rauf to return from the BBL in order to prepare for the PSL which commences on January 27. In a statement, the Brisbane Heat franchise said they are 'disappointed' that the opener, Zaman won't play in the remaining matches. He was signed by the franchise on December 31 last year, but he played just one game due to Covid-19-related travel restrictions. Meanwhile, Rauf confirmed via his Twitter handle that he was leaving Melbourne Stars with two matches remaining. On the other hand, Adelaide Strikers lost out on the services of Rashid Khan for the rest of the tournament due to the spinner having international commitments. ""Unfortunately the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed it had rescinded its permission for Fakhar to play our remaining games, along with all Pakistan players currently involved in the BBL, and summoned him to return immediately to prepare for the Pakistan Super League,"" Heat said in a statement on Sunday (January 16). ""We are disappointed that he won't be able to play for us and he is disappointed he won't have the opportunity to get some more games in for us. He asked us to thank the fans for their support and wish the team all the best for the remaining three games,"" the statement added. Heat, though, received a boost as Michael Neser and Mitchell Swepson are returning to the fold for their game versus Stars. Mitchell Marsh and Josh Inglis were also released from the Australian Test set-up and will play for Perth Scorchers. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,16/01/2022
Gritty Ireland eye series win,"ShareTweet Despite Covid cases in the camp and an injury scare or two, Ireland pulled one back in the rain-curtailed second ODI against the West Indies in Jamaica. Andy McBrine, who was hit on the head in the previous game, turned his campaign around by compiling a crucial hand of 35 and took four wickets as Ireland won by a margin of five wickets. Harry Tector too made an impression with his second fifty of the series. The promising batter had also scored fifties versus the Netherlands, South Africa and Zimbabwe last year. With their regular skipper - Andrew Balbirnie - testing positive for COVID-19, Tector has been the backbone of the batting unit. In the pace bowling department, Craig Young and Joshua Little have also picked up crucial wickets in the series so far. If anything, Ireland can look to improve their bowling in the slog overs. As Stirling himself noted in the post-match presentation after the second ODI: ""The last 10 overs of the bowling innings, we can finish better."" On the other hand, the hosts have a problem or two at the top of the order. In both the matches, Shai Hope, Justin Greaves and Nicholas Pooran struggled to make an impact at the top of the order. The focus would be on currently their best ODI batter Hope to provide the platform. When put under pressure in the second game, the bowlers couldn't make inroads at regular intervals. The coaching staff would look at Alzarri Joseph, Romario Shepherd and Odean Smith to bowl with the kind of penetration and discipline that they displayed in the opening encounter. Ireland are placed fourth (50 points) while West Indies are at the eighth slot (40 points) in the Men's Cricket World Cup Super League table. So the significance of this match is a lot more than just a series win. When: Sunday, January 16 at 9:30 AM Local Time (8:00 PM IST) Where: Sabina Park, Kingston, Jamaica What to expect: There is a slim chance of a rain shower but the weather forecast looks promising. Teams News: West Indies: The West Indies could look at giving one more chance to Greaves at the top of the order. Devon Thomas (wicketkeeper-batter) is the reserve batter. Probable XI: Shai Hope (wk), Justin Greaves, Nicholas Pooran, Shamarh Brooks, Kieron Pollard (c), Roston Chase, Jason Holder, Romario Shepherd, Odeon Smith, Alzarri Joseph, Akeal Hosein Ireland: As Ireland are grappling with Covid cases in the camp, the visitors are unlikely to make changes to the winning XI. Probable XI:William Porterfield, Paul Stirling (c), Andy McBrine, Harry Tector, Curtis Campher, George Dockrell, Gareth Delany, Neil Rock (WK), Mark Adair, Craig Young and Joshua Little. What they said: ""It means a lot. We are delighted how the lads have responded. We are delighted to get the win. Just got a good grab (about taking a good catch today),"" Stirling said after the second game. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,16/01/2022
Wood five-fer keeps England in the game,"ShareTweet Mark Wood produced a lion-hearted bowling effort on the third afternoon of the Day-Night Hobart Test, his third Test match five-fer keeping England in the contest. At Dinner break, Australia were reduced to 141 for 8, an overall lead of 256. England, who had conceded a 115-run first-innings lead following another forgettable batting show, had clawed back some of the deficit by taking out three Australian wickets late last night. But it needed an even better performance in less conducive conditions this afternoon for them to entertain any thoughts of a comeback. Wood provided just that while operating in tandem with Stuart Broad. Into the fourth over of the day's play he hit the hard length and got a delivery to climb steeply towards Scott Boland's throat, something the nightwatchman could only glove to the 'keeper. Two overs later, he accounted for first-innings centurion Travis Head, who became the latest in a list of batsmen strangled down the legside in this game. The short ball theory, though, got its greatest stamp of approval when Steve Smith was consumed on the pull at fine-leg. Australia at that stage were reduced to 63 for 6 with England entertaining the possibility of chasing a target under or close to 200. Expectedly there was resistance once Wood's impressive spell of 6-0-12-3 came to an end. Alex Carey and Cameron Green got together to add risk free runs but not without some luck along the way. Carey played on to a Chris Woakes delivery while on 19 only for the third umpires to reveal that the bowler had marginally overstepped. Carey was also adjudged LBW, a decision that he overturned with a review. The 49-run partnership was eventually ended when Broad had Green ruled out LBW with a review. Wood then returned for another spell and used his patented short ball to have Mitchell Starc caught at short leg. Carey though remained unbeaten on 40 and took the lead past the psychological 250 mark. Brief scores: Australia 141/8 (Alex Carey 40* ; Mark Wood 5-32) & 303 lead England 188 by 256 runs.

"Live Cricket Score - Australia vs England, 5th Test, Day 3","ShareTweet Over: England lose by 146; Australia take the Ashes 4-0 They lost the last 10 wickets for 56 runs. That is a collapse and a half. Embarrassing for an England side, who may have even considered to have been in the chase at Tea time. The reality of the matter is, their batting has just not been good enough. They collapsed in one session and the game's over in less than nine (remember we lost most of the final session on Day 1) Basically, the match slipped out of England's hands on day 1 itself when they gave away almost 250 runs in conditions where the ball darted around considerably. It's 4-0 for Australia! And a lot of soul-searching to do for England. Hang around Cricbuzz for all the follow-up stories. We'll sign off from this Ashes series here with a couple of reactions from Social Media. Happening quickly now, Australia three away A pretty sorry dismissal for Ollie Pope. He walks across his stumps and misses a straight ball and is bowled. The first of the innings for Cummins, who has 19 for the series in his Ashes as captain. Boland gets another, Australia four away Could it actually get over today? Sam Billings chips a catch to mid-on and Australia are into Woakes and the lower-order now. Pretty ordinary stuff (not new) from England's batsmen. Root falls: Is that 4-0? Not much Root can do about this ball from Boland. Keeps low and slips under his defence to rattle the stumps. No hundred in Australia for the England captain, he's had a couple of good knocks but after that 2021, a lull was to be expected. Short-ball return gift Starc comes back for a new spell and gives his captain a big breakthrough. He goes for a surprise short ball and Ben Stokes decides to take him on. Gets it high on the bat and finds Nathan Lyon at deep square leg. Massive wicket this and Australia are on their way now, you'd expect, to that 4-0 result. England 92/4 Three for Green and England are sliding From 68/0 to 83/3. Just England things. But this is a fine spell from Australia's rising star all-rounder. Full with a hint of late outswing. Crawley can't get to the pitch while driving and nicks the ball to the 'keeper. This innings typifies all that's worrying for England as a batting unit. Pretty 36 and gone! A second wicket after Tea for Green And it's another chop on, this time from Malan. After a good start, England are two down for 82. Malan was troubled by Green, who beat the bat and even struck the left-hander on the helmet. Over to Joe Root once again, with the target 189 runs away. Tea: Burns falls at the stroke of the break Heartbreak for him and the England fans. It's the last over before the Tea interval and he plays on a ball from Cam Green. Gone for 26 and England's promising 68-run opening stand is ended. They are 203 away. Bright start to the chase England's best opening stand of the series was 47. Burns and Crawley have got to that in 9 overs. Some brisk scoring. Of course there have been some close LBW shouts and referrals. But there is promise. Two runs later: England 51, Australia 49 Update: Burns has let his hair down Frankly it was time. Just throw caution to the wind and play a sprightly knock here. As it is he is under pressure. A bit of carefree approach couldn't do more harm, could it? If it's for luck, it's working for the moment. Outside edges flying into the gaps, LBW appeals not convincing. 20/0 inside five overs. Wood gets six; Target for England - 271 And it ends with Wood getting 6 for 37 , his best figures in Test cricket. Pat Cummins is the last man out, cleaned up by a fast and straight ball. It's been a great series for Wood, barring that first innings here in Hobart where he was counter-attacked. But his short-ball ploy did rattle one or two members of the Australian top order. He can put his feet up for now, unless he's called out early to bat. England need 271 to make it 3-1. Australia need 10 wickets for 4-0! England have taken all 20 wickets in an Ashes Test in Australia for the first time since Sydney 2014 - 10 matches ago. Carey falls for 49; Lead past 260 Misses out on the 50 but this has been a fine innings from Australia's keeper-bat under the circumstances. He inisde edges a Broad delivery to Sam Billings behind the stumps, but with Australia's lead now nearing 270, he's done his job. One wicket still left for England to take. Dinner: Australia lead by 256 They have enough already, some would reckon. They wouldn't be wrong given what we've seen with England's batting this series. They have two wickets in hand, including Carey who is on 40* and Lyon in the hut (who added 31 in the first innings). Five-fer for Wood A lion-hearted bowling performance that keeps England in the game, just about. It's another short ball and Starc has fended it off his hips to the short-leg fielder stationed for that very response. Tremendous effort this after that first-innings misstep. Can England bowl Australia out and chase a score under 250? Australia still have some nuggety tail-enders to come. Broad breaks resistance Green plays inside the line to a delivery that nips away ever so slightly. He is pinged on the pad and is out LBW after a review. End of a 49-run stand. Australia lead by 227 with 3 wickets in hand. Wicket of a no-ball Rabada bowled so many of these in that South Africa - India series, none however cost him a wicket. Here Woakes' transgression (not sure if it's that big to be honest) has cost England the Carey wicket. The Australian keeper-bat played on but will continue batting. He was on 19. The lead will build. Lead passes 200 Steady stand between Carey and Green. Nothing flashy. Old fashioned Test cricket once Wood was done with his spell. It also shows that there are runs on the pitch at opportune times. Smith falls to a bouncer trap Three in the morning for Wood and four in the innings so far. Another short ball with a trap set. Smith takes it on and finds the man at fine-leg. Australia are 63/6, effectively ahead by 178. Great intent from the visitors so far. A second for Wood this morning The short ball theory keeps bringing him rewards. This one is down the legside but the awkward bounce means Travis Head is in no control of the tuck. Gloves it to the keeper. England fighting and staying in contention. Australia lead by 176 with 5 wickets in hand. The nightwatchman is packed off Mark Wood bowls a perfume ball that Boland can only glove it to the 'keeper. Australia are effectively 162/4. Broad has had a couple of LBW appeals against Steve Smith at the other end and now the Australian vice-captain is joined by first-innings centurion Travis Head. Smith and Boland walk out Broad with a 19-over-old ball. Pristine batting conditions now. Can England get an opening? Tee hee   Prelude - Day 3 The traditional moving day. But this Test has already moved at the rate of knots after a 17-wicket day yesterday. Australia are ahead as a lead of 152 would suggest but they have as yet to close the door shut on the opposition. England had another forgettable day with the bat yesterday but their bowlers can give their batters one final chance to redeem themselves. Broad and Co. were excellent last evening when they knocked Australia's top-three off. Now they have a Steve Smith-shaped mountain to get past. Should be an interesting day of cricket, this.

Under-19 World Cup wrap - Yash Dhull fifty gives India winning start,"ShareTweet Canada U19 vs United Arab Emirates U19 UAE made a winning start to the tournament after a 49-run win over Canada, restricting them to 235 in a chase of 285. After opting to bat UAE were led by Punya Mehra (71) and Ali Naseer, who got respective scores in the 70s to take them to a strong total. Skipper Alishan chipped in with 37, as did Nilansh Keswani with 39, but it was Naseer's 73 off 50 at No.7 - that included five fours and four sixes - that made the difference between a 220 finish and a 280-plus one. Canada were kept in the chase by skipper Mihir Patel who at No.4 held the innings together with 96, but fell short of a deserved century. But Canada losing wickets at regular intervals meant they fell well-short in the end. Kairav Sharma made a 43 lower down the order, but too much was left to do in the end as Canada were bowled out for 235 in 46.4 overs. Brief scores: UAE U19 284/7 in 50 overs (Alishan Sharafu 37, Punya Mehra 71, Nilansh Keswani 39, Ali Naseer 73; Parmveer Kharoud 2-49, Gurnek Johal Singh 2-38) beat Canada U19 235 in 46.4 overs (Anoop Chima 46, Mihir Patel 96, Kairav Sharma 43; Nilansh Keswani 2-32, Adhitya Shetty 2-64, Jash Giyanani 2-10, Alishan Sharafu 2-27) by 49 runs. India U19 vs South Africa U19 India started their campaign in Group B with a 45-run win over South Africa. Although it was not their best game with the bat being bowled out for 232, but they still managed to win quite comfortably in the end. Chasing 233, South Africa fell comfortably short despite having gotten off to a good start, with 55 on the board after 11 overs for just one wicket. Even as Dewald Brevis was batting beautifully, it was in the middle overs where they lost the game as they got strangled by spin on a pitch where the ball was gripping. The runs were hard to come by with Vicky Ostwal, Nishant Sindhu and Kaushal Tambe giving nothing away. From overs 12-31, the whole 20 over-phase yielded just 64. South Africa couldn't handle that pressure and it sparked a mighty collapse with the side losing their last seven wickets for 49 as Ostwal returned 5-28, while Raj Bawa had 4-47. India earlier got to 232 thanks to captain Yash Dhull's knock of 82. Kaushal Tambe put on a 44-ball 35 and although the total didn't seem like the strongest, it proved enough with South Africa being bowled out for 187. Brief scores: India U19 232 in 46.4 overs (Shaik Rasheed 31, Yash Dhull 82, Kaushal Tambe 35; Matthew Boast 3-40, Aphiwe Mnyanda 2-29, Dewald Brevis 2-43) beat South Africa U19 187 in 45.4 overs(Dewald Brevis 65, George Van Heerden 36; Raj Bawa 4-47, Vicky Ostwal 5-28) by 45 runs. Ireland U19 vs Uganda U19 In Group B, Ireland beat Uganda by 39 runs for their first win in the competition. Joshua Cox scored an incredible century at almost a run a ball to lead Ireland to 236. No other batsman other than Cox really settled in after Philippus le Roux, David Vincent and Scott MacBeth got starts. Uganda, meanwhile, had their chase derailed with early wickets from where they couldn't return. Although skipper Pascal Murungi scored an 82-ball 63, it wasn't enough to take them even close to the target as Matthew Humphreys returned a four-wicket haul. Brief scores: Ireland U19 236/9 in 50 overs (Joshua Cox 111, Philippus le Roux 32; Juma Miyaji 2-56, Pascal Murungi 2-44, Joseph Baguma 2-34, Matthew Musinguzi 2-35) beat Uganda U19 197 in 48.1 overs (Pascal Murungi 63, Juma Miyaji 38; Matthew Humphreys 4-25, Muzamil Sherzad 2-46, Nathan McGuire 2-29) by 39 runs. Zimbabwe U19 vs Papua New Guinea U19 Zimbabwe picked up first points in a massive 228-run win over PNG who were bowled out for just 93 in a chase of 322. Emmanuel Bawa's 100 off 95 led Zimbabwe's charge early on as he stitched stands with Panashe Taruvinga (36) and David Bennett (58) to keep Zimbabwe on course for a big total finish. He fell, however, soon after his century but Victor Chirwa's 16-all 35 at No.9 helped them past 300. Chirwa carried forward the momentum with the ball too, picking up two wickets, but more importantly, conceding just 11 runs in his seven overs. Zimbabwe's bowlers were all over PNG's batsmen from the start with the top score being 15 before they were bowled out in 35 overs. Brief scores: Zimbabwe U19 321/9 in 50 overs (Panashe Taruvinga 36, Emmanuel Bawa 100, David Bennett 58, Connor Mitchell 35, Victor Chirwa 35; Rasan Kevau 3-65) beat Papua New Guinea U19 93 in 35 overs (Ngenyasha Zvinoera 2-25, Brian Bennett 2-20, Victor Chirwa 2-11) by 228 runs.

Stats: India's incredible journey under Captain Kohli,"ShareTweet December 30, 2014. After the Boxing Day Test at the MCG ended in a stalemate, MS Dhoni caught everyone off guard by announcing his retirement from red-ball cricket with immediate effect. With the Test ending in a draw, India conceded the series to Australia - fourth in a row following defeats in South Africa, New Zealand, and England in the preceding 12 months with India winning a solitary Test across the four tours. India languished at the seventh position in the ICC Test rankings only ahead of West Indies, Bangladesh, and Zimbabwe. With Sachin Tendulkar retiring a year ago, the transition was complete as a new era dawned in Indian cricket. Zaheer Khan and Virender Sehwag bid adieu to international cricket before Dhoni while Ishant Sharma and Umesh Yadav had still not converted their potential to match winning performances. R Ashwin was found wanting in alien foreign conditions after a brilliant start to his Test career at home, while Ravindra Jadeja was grinding it out in the first-class circuit to make a comeback. The responsibility of lifting India from doldrums in Test cricket wrested with Virat Kohli. Already established as the best white-ball batsman in the world, Kohli was in the middle of a purple patch with the bat when he took over the captaincy from Dhoni. The cricketing world already got a taste of his captaincy when he stood as the stand-in skipper in the first Test in Adelaide. Unlike his predecessor, he surprised everyone as he went for an unlikely win on the final day chasing 364 and he nearly pulled off a miracle before falling short by 48 runs. Five years down the line, he led India to the top of ICC rankings, won back to back series in Sri Lanka and West Indies, became the first Asian captain to win a series Down Under and led India to unprecedented dominance at home extending their unbeaten run to 14 consecutive series since 2013. On the day he stepped down as Test skipper, we take a look back at India's incredible journey under Kohli through numbers. Captains leading in most Tests Player Mat Won Lost Draw Tied Win %     Graeme Smith 109 53 29 27 0 48.62   Allan Border 93 32 22 38 1 34.41   Stephen Fleming 80 28 27 25 0 35   Ricky Ponting 77 48 16 13 0 62.34   Clive Lloyd 74 36 12 26 0 48.65   Virat Kohli 68 40 17 11 0 58.82   MS Dhoni 60 27 18 15 0 45   Joe Root 60 27 24 9 0 45   Alastair Cook 59 24 22 13 0 40.68   Steve Waugh 57 41 9 7 0 71.93 58.82 - Kohli's win percentage of 58.82% is the third best for any captain to have led in at least 25 Tests behind Steve Waugh's 71.93% and Ricky Ponting's 62.34%. India's 40 Test wins under Kohli is the fourth most under a skipper only behind Graeme Smith (53), Ponting (48) and Waugh (41). 13 - India's 40 Test wins under Kohli is 13 more than the next best - 27 victories in 60 Tests under Dhoni. Among the 16 Indian players to have led in at least ten Tests, Kohli is the only one to register wins in more than half the number of games he led. 16 overseas wins under Kohli is also the most among Indian captains, five more than 11 under Sourav Ganguly. It's not only the count of wins that makes Kohli's reign special but the manner of victories. Of India's top ten Test wins by runs margin, seven have come under Kohli including six of the top seven. India have won two overseas Tests by a 300-plus margin, both under Kohli - 318 runs in North Sound in 2019 and 304 runs in Galle in 2017. To add, India's biggest ever innings win - by an innings and 272 runs - also came under Kohli's stewardship against West Indies in Rajkot in October 2018. In the 2019/20 home season, India won four successive Tests by an innings margin under Kohli - the only such instance in the history of Test cricket.

Even though India produced some of the most iconic spin bowlers in the world, Kohli realized the importance of a pace bowling unit to succeed in overseas conditions and in Ravi Shastri and Bharat Arun he had two lieutenants who brought this vision. Ishant and Umesh became far better versions of themselves under Kohli than under his predecessors. Mohammed Shami became fitter and added a cutting edge to his bowling in the second phase of his career. The fast tracking and emergence of Jasprit Bumrah in the longest format is one of the biggest success stories in Indian cricket. India seamers under different captains Captain Matches Wickets Avg SR 5-fers Wkts/Test     V Kohli 68 591 26 51.3 22 8.7   Kapil Dev 34 211 30.24 62.1 9 6.2   R Dravid 25 211 34.21 61.2 5 8.4   Azharuddin 47 319 34.45 74.5 8 6.8   S Tendulkar 25 182 35.56 68.7 8 7.3   S Gavaskar 47 304 35.57 66.5 18 6.5   MS Dhoni 60 466 36.65 63.9 17 7.8   S Ganguly 49 361 36.72 68.7 16 7.4   MAK Pataudi 40 109 40.35 83.3 1 2.7 As we can infer from the above table, the best period for India's fast bowlers have come under Kohli's captaincy - they take 8.7 wickets every Test at an average of 26. In overseas Tests, the parameters improve to 11 wickets per Test at 26.55 - both parameters the best among Indian skippers to lead in ten-plus away games. The only skipper under whom Indian seamers averaged less than 30 in away Tests is under Kapil Dev - 28.06. However, unlike the current crop where Kohli have a plethora of choices to dig his hands on, Kapil mostly had a seamer or two at the most to rely upon apart from himself. Overall, six bowlers have taken 100+ wickets under Kohli making it the second most instances under a captain behind Smith's seven. Though he was left out of the playing XI in entirety in tours to West Indies and England, R Ashwin has fared way better under Kohli - both home and away - than any other captain. In 55 Tests under Kohli, Ashwin has picked 293 wickets at 22.13 (only Dale Steyn's 347 under Smith is higher among bowler-captain combinations) while in 29 Tests with someone else in charge the average shoots to 29.18. Bowlers with 100+ wickets under Kohli Player Matches Wickets Avg SR 5-fers 10-fers     R Ashwin 55 293 22.13 48.2 21 5   Mohd Shami 46 168 24.82 47.1 5 0   R Jadeja 40 165 24.72 60.8 7 1   I Sharma 43 121 25.85 55.6 5 0   U Yadav 37 104 30.68 54.9 2 1   J Bumrah 24 103 21.55 49.1 7 0 Stepping the game up as a batsman India has produced some of the best batsmen in red-ball cricket who have invariably struggled to bring their best out once they were given the responsibility to lead the sides. MAK Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar, Mohammad Azharuddin, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly and Rahul Dravid, all belonged to the mould as they performed better as a batsman when not in charge. However, Kohli belongs to a different kettle of fish. Not only he has taken up captaincy like fish to water, but he also elevated his batsmanship to the next level. His average shoots up to 54.80 as captain compared to 41.13 as a player. In the 68 matches as skipper, Kohli has scored 5864 runs and trails only Smith (8659), Border (6623), and Ponting (6542) in terms of runs scored while his 20 three-figure scores while leading is only behind Smith's 25. 7 Double hundreds by Kohli is the most by captain in Test cricket, two more than the next best of five by Brian Lara. All other Indian captains put together have only managed four such scores among them. Kohli hit three double hundreds each in calendar years 2016 and 2017, only behind Michael Clarke's four in 2012 among captains. 254 by Kohli against South Africa in Pune is the highest score by an Indian captain in Test cricket. He sits in the second and third spot as well with scores of 243 against Sri Lanka in Delhi and 235 against England in Mumbai. His 200 against West Indies in North Sound is the highest by an Indian captain in an overseas Test. 41 Hundreds by Kohli while leading India - 20 in Tests and 21 in ODIs - is the joint most by any captain in international cricket. Ponting has also scored as many but his 41 hundreds came in 376 innings compared to just 250 innings for Kohli. The series defeats in England in 2018 and in South Africa in 2018 and 2021/22 have turned out to be ""what-ifs"" in Kohli's legacy as captain. Though his list of achievements supersedes that of any other skipper from the sub-continent, these three series have left the team short of the greatness that it aspired for. From down in the doldrums when he took over the reins, Kohli has taken this side to an impeccable winning unit at home and near favourites wherever they play away. And for that Kohli deserves to be celebrated as the finest leader India have ever had in the format. The article is an updated version of the piece that was first published on Sep 3, 2019 when Virat Kohli became India's most successful Test captain. ShareTweet",Deepu Narayanan,15/01/2022
Nabi rules himself out of Netherlands ODIs,"ShareTweet Mohammad Nabi has ruled himself out from Afghanistan's upcoming series three-match One-Day International (ODI) series against Netherlands with a view to give a younger player an opportunity. The Afghanistan Cricket Board announced an 18-player squad for the series, which is set to be played in Doha from January 21 to 25, on Sunday (January 15). Hashmatullah Shahidi was announced as the country's new ODI (and Test) captain last year. Nabi's exclusion from the side follows 22-year pacer Naveen-ul-Haq's decision to step aside from the 50-over format in order to concentrate on the 2022 T20 World Cup set to be played in Australia later in the year. The squad includes several uncapped cricketers in the ODI format, such as Fazal Farooqi, Shahidullah Kamal and Hassan Riaz who's uncapped in all formats. Squad: Azmatullah Omarzai, Farid Malik, Fazal Haq Farooqi, Gulbadin Naib, Hashmatullah Shahidi (c), Ikram Alikhail, Mujib ur Rahman, Najibullah Zadran, Qais Ahmad, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Rahmat Shah, Rashid Khan, Hassan Riaz, Salim Safi, Shahidullah Kamal, Sharafuddin Ashraf, Usman Ghani, Yamin Ahmadzai The three ODIs will form a part of the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, through which the top seven teams apart from hosts India will qualify directly for the 2023 50-over World Cup. Afghanistan, who have played only three of the 24 ODIs, are currently placed 11th on the table. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,15/01/2022
Depleted Sri Lanka seek Super League push,"ShareTweet At a point when Sri Lanka best stood to improve their position in the Super League, they have been hit by a spate of issues ahead of the home ODIs against Zimbabwe. It's all falling apart for them. Bhanuka Rajapjksa opted to retire from cricket, Lahiru Kumara, Akila Dhananjaya and Binura Fernando have failed to pass the fitness test, Kusal Perera and Wanindu Hasaranga were ruled out due to injuries and a couple of uncapped players were tested positive for COVID-19. With Sri Lanka's chances of qualifying directly for the 2023 50-over World Cup looking slim, playing Zimbabwe at home was an ideal opportunity to improve their position. But they end up going into the contest uncertain of what is to be expected by the return of some experienced players like Kusal Mendis and Jeffrey Vandersay as well as the new-look pace attack, which includes three uncapped pacers - Nuwan Thushara, Chamika Gunasekara and Shiran Fernando. With only two more ODI series remaining to be played in the Super League after the Zimbabwe series, the Dasun Shanaka led side would be eager to cleansweep the visitors and keep the competition from Pakistan, South Africa, Afghanistan and New Zealand competitive for a top-eight finish. Much of where they stand against Zimbabwe will be reflected in the first one-dayer, set to be played on Monday (January 16) in Pallekele. A fairly impressive performance against South Africa, which followed a series loss against a second string Indian side at home, had provided them the momentum, even if late in the league. But with eight changes to the side will they manage to dominate Zimbabwe, who too will be holding similar aspirations. Zimbabwe, placed at the bottom of the 13-team table, have been short on match practice, having played only a solitary ODI series in 2021 - a rain-marred three-match series in Ireland, which they leveled 1-1. Craig Ervine gets the charge yet again to help Zimbabwe's dwindling hopes. When: Monday, January 16, 2022, 2:30 PM Local Time Where: Pallekele International Stadium What to expect: Even as scattered thunderstorms are expected, a full 100 overs of play can be expected in fairly pleasant conditions Team News Sri Lanka: The hosts have made eight changes to their side for the series. A lot of new faces have been included and a few old ones recalled. How they plan to fit in remains to be seen. Squad: Pathum Nissanka, Minod Bhanuka, Kusal Mendis, Dinesh Chandimal (wk), Charith Asalanka, Dasun Shanaka (c), Ramesh Mendis, Chamika Karunaratne, Dushmantha Chameera, Maheesh Theekshana, Nuwan Pradeep, Praveen Jayawickrama, Jeffrey Vandersay, Shiran Fernando, Nuwan Thushara, Chamika Gunasekara, Kamindu Mendis Zimbabwe: The visitors will be without their head coach, Lalchand Rajput, who tested positive for COVID-19 ahead of the series. The Craig Ervine-led side has a couple of uncapped players but they are unlikely to get a look in. Squad: Milton Shumba, Regis Chakabva (w), Craig Ervine(c), Wesley Madhevere, Sean Williams, Sikandar Raza, Ryan Burl, Luke Jongwe, Wellington Masakadza, Blessing Muzarabani, Richard Ngarava, Takudzwanashe Kaitano, Clive Madande, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Tendai Chatara ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,15/01/2022
'Whoaaa... Didn't see that coming',"ShareTweet A day after India's series loss in South Africa, Virat Kohli announced his decision to relinquish India's Test captaincy. Kohli had earlier stepped down as India's T20I captain, at the conclusion of the 2021 T20 World Cup, and was subsequently replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's white-ball captain ahead of India's tour of South Africa.

"Wells, Thornton helps Strikers march to third successive win","ShareTweet Adelaide Strikers vs Melbourne Stars Jonathan Well's career-best 73 followed by Henry Thornton's four-fer helped Adelaide Strikers march to their third successive victory, thereby consolidating their fourth spot in the points table as they comfortably beat Melbourne Stars by 23 runs. Put in to bat first, Strikers' flying start was courtesy Matthew Short's 22-ball 33 but at 69 for 3 after nine overs, they were struggling for momentum. That's when Wells stepped up with some late hitting to propel his side to a competitive total of 155 for 6. He played the aggressor in the 61-run stand with Jake Weatherald, who chipped in a sedate 17. Not only that, but Wells was also instrumental in Strikers stealing 50 off their final five overs, en route raising a 36-ball fifty, before falling off the last delivery of their batting innings. Glenn Maxwell got the Stars' chase off to a brisk start as well, slog-sweeping Short for a six off just the second delivery. He was also reprieved early but the drop did not cost Strikers a lot as Thornton opened his account in the third over. That triggered a decisive collapse of 4 for 16 - one that Stars couldn't recover from. Hilton Cartwright launched a late assault, but all it did was prevent a free fall and reduce the margin of their defeat. He hit three sixes and two boundaries in his 35-ball effort before being dismissed one short of a fifty, becoming Thornton's first of the two victims in the 19th over as Stars were restricted to 132 in reply. Brief scores: Adelaide Strikers 155/6 in 20 overs (Jonathan Wells 73, Matthew Short 33; Sam Rainbird 2-25) beat Melbourne Stars 132/8 in 20 overs (Hilton Cartwright 49; Henry Thornton 4-26) by 23 runs. Sydney Sixers vs Sydney Thunder Fifties from Daniel Hughes and Josh Philipe, followed by a four-fer from Steve O'Keefe helped Sixers thrash Thunder by 60 runs in Sydney derby at the SCG to move into the second spot in the points tally. Sixers' batting picked up after a slow start, courtesy the 82-run second wicket partnership between the two half-centurions. Having finished the powerplay on 8 for 1, the pair plucked 45 runs in the next four overs to signal the change of momentum. Philippe played a dominant hand in that partnership, making 35-ball 57 studded with two sixes and five more boundaries. Hughes then combined for a 77-run stand with skipper Moises Henriques, putting in a top-scoring effort of 66 in just 48 deliveries including a couple of sixes and seven fours. Sixers lost three wickets in the space of six deliveries across the 18th and 19th over, but Henriques kept the assault going from his end to finish with an unbeaten 47 off 27 that propelled his side to a challenging 197/5. Despite an early jolt, Alex Hales (23) and Jason Sangha (22) propped up Thunder's chase to take them to 42/1 before OKeefe turned the game on its head in his first spell. The spinner dismissed Hales and Alex Ross in his first over and Daniel Sams and Oliver Davies in the third as Thunder slipped to 61 for 5 in no time. Ben Dwarshuis then picked a wicket each in his two successive overs to leave Thunder reeling at 79 for 7 - a point of no return. The resistance came in the form of a quick fifty from Chris Green but it was too late in the day for Thunder, who still fell 60 runs short of the target. Brief scores: Sydney Sixers 197/5 in 20 overs (Daniel Hughes 66, Josh Philippe 57, Moises Henriques 47; Daniel Sams 2-43) beat Sydney Thunder 137/9 in 20 overs (Chris Green 50; Steve OKeefe 4-18, Ben Dwarshius 2-23) by 60 runs ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,15/01/2022
Kohli steps down as India's Test captain,"ShareTweet Virat Kohli has stepped down as the Test captain of India with immediate effect, he confirmed on Saturday (January 15). Kohli's decision comes a day after India fell short in their quest to clinch their first-ever series in South Africa. Despite winning the opening Test, India conceded the series 2-1. The 33-year-old, who conveyed his decision via social media, had recently stepped down as India's T20I skipper and was subsequently removed as the ODI captain ahead of the South Africa tour. Kohli's statement: ""It's been 7 years of hard work, toil and relentless perseverance everyday to take the team in the right direction. I've done the job with absolute honesty and left nothing out there. Every thing has to come to a halt at some stage and for me as Test Captain of India, it's now. There have been many ups and also some downs along the journey, but never has there been a lack of effort or lack of belief. I have always believed in giving my 120 percent in everything I do, and if I can't do that, I know it's not the right thing to do. I have absolute clarity in my heart and I cannot be dishonest to my team. ""I want to thank the BCCI for giving me the opportunity to lead my country for such a long period of time and more importantly to all the teammates who bought into the vision I had for the team from day one and never gave up in any situation. You guys have made this journey so memorable and beautiful. To Ravi Bhai and the support group who were the engine behind this vehicle that moved us upwards in Test Cricket consistently, you all have played a massive role in bringing this vision to life. Lastly, a big thank you to MS Dhoni who believed in me as a Captain and found me to be an able individual who could take Indian Cricket forward."" Kohli first led India in a Test match by the end of 2014 in Adelaide in MS Dhoni's absence. He took over as the full time captain in the same series immediately after Dhoni's Test retirement. Over the years, Kohli's success as captain in Tests also led to him taking over the reins in the other formats once Dhoni stepped down. Eventually, he surpassed Dhoni and became the most successful Indian Test captain. Under Kohli, India reached the summit in the Test rankings and managed to win a Test series in Australia for the first time in their history, in 2018-19. While Australia were weakened in the batting department in that series, India under Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane returned to those shores two years later to beat them again. India are also currently leading the series in England 2-1 and will return this year to play the fifth and final Test. In the inaugural World Test Championship, India reached the final but ended up losing to New Zealand. Overall, India have won 40 Tests under Kohli with only Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting and Steve Waugh ahead of him in the all-time list. ShareTweet",Cricbuzz Staff,15/01/2022
